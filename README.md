#Gore

**Golang** reference repository containing several kinds of examples organized by folder.

Currently it contains:


#### Basic Knowledge:
* Golang basics with _TDD_ as seen on [Learn Go by Writing Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)


#### API's and Frontend:
* Different approaches on writing APIs
    * Simple restful API in on file (which you should never do) using mux.
    * Structured restul API (which I think you should do) using mux.
    * Fullstack example with _Go_ + _Gin_ + probably _Vuexpress_ because I want to play with that.

More code is always planned to be added.
